The web application intended to be developed should enable users to view a list of trending comics with just a click of a button. Once the button is clicked a window will pop up displaying the list of trending comics from the linked to the API of Webtoon which is home to various comics of all kinds of genres. Instead of a user going to search through various lists that may be outdated, the intended web application should be able to help them save time and enable them to access the list fast. The problem of scrolling through long outdated lists will then be solved with a click of a button.
